Here I created a multi-digit generator which generate images of number based on MNIST dataset with Keras and OpenCV

I have done a notebook for detail information on [KAGGLE](https://www.kaggle.com/bomaich/multi-digit-images-generate-mnist)

You can see the result here:

As you can see, the picture of multi digit are generated but what are those tiny number on top of each picture??
Those were the predicted number come out of my model. If you want to know how to regconise multi digit with CRNN + CTC loss. Please follow this link
